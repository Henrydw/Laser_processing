%% Generate image aligment surfaces
% a program to generate the image offset surafaces required to properly
% centre images on the laser.

% REASON: the f-theta lens induces an offset since the imageing wavelengths
% (700nm & 950nm) do not match the wavelength the lens is designed for 
% (1070nm) . Therefore the point of laser contact (meltpool) appears to 
% drift around the image when it should stay centre, this occurs by 
% different amounts for each image due to their seperate wavelenghts:

% ISSUE: if the melt pools cannot be properly aligned then the ratio 
% (and consequnetly the temperature) cannot be ascertained

%% Input??
